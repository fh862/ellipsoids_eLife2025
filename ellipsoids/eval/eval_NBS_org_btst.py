Evaluate the agreement between an original-data Wishart fit and its bootstrap
fits on a common fine prediction grid.

Legacy filename
---------------
This script was originally written only for normalized Bures similarity (NBS),
which is why its filename remains ``eval_NBS_org_btst.py``. The legacy name is
retained for legacy use only, so existing workflows and references do not
break, but the script now supports both NBS and the affine-invariant Riemannian
metric (AIRM). Set ``metric`` below to select which quantity is computed.

Supported metrics
-----------------
``metric = "NBS"``
    Computes normalized Bures similarity with
    ``compute_normalized_Bures_similarity_batch`` and caches it under
    ``NBS_fine_grid``. Larger dataset-level sums indicate greater similarity.

``metric = "AIRM"``
    Computes squared affine-invariant Riemannian distances with
    ``spd_affine_dist_sq_batch`` and caches them under ``AIRM_fine_grid``.
    Smaller dataset-level sums indicate a bootstrap fit closer to the original
    fit. Despite the cache-key shorthand, each grid value is a squared AIRM
    distance.

Caching and downstream use
--------------------------
The selected original-fit pickle is updated with ``grid_fine`` and
``Sigmas_noise_grid_org`` when needed. Each bootstrap pickle is updated with
the matching fine grid, ``Sigmas_noise_grid_btst``, and the selected metric's
fine-grid values. Compatible cached quantities are reused, so running the
script once for NBS and again for AIRM does not recompute covariance matrices.

Downstream scripts such as ``visualize_CI_Wishart_grid_2d.py`` sum the selected
fine-grid values to obtain one score per bootstrap dataset. NBS must be ranked
in descending order, whereas AIRM must be ranked in ascending order.
